# Real-Time-Audio-Visualizer

This project consists of a FPGA programme to visualize audio input from a microphone and display the signals interactively in different visualizations. I also developed a frequency detector algorithm with an accuracy > 95% and programmed a 7SEG display to show the detected frequency. In addition, a pong game was developed whereby audio signals are used to control the pedals.
