# Real-Time-Audio-Visualizer

## Project Description
This project consists of a Sound & Entertainment System to visualize audio input from a microphone and display the signals interactively in different visualizations. The project was built with Verilog, Digilent Basys 3 Board, Pmod OLEDrgb 96 x 64 RGB OLED Display and Pmod MIC3. The notable features include pong game (where audio signals are used to control the pedals), responsiveness to audio which make for an entertaining and interactive experience. The frequency detector algorithm implemented was able to achieve an accuracy of over 95%.
