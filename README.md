# Real-Time-Audio-Visualizer

## Project Description
This project consists of a Sound & Entertainment System to visualize audio input from a microphone and display the signals interactively in different visualizations. The project was built with Verilog, Digilent Basys 3 Board, Pmod OLEDrgb 96 x 64 RGB OLED Display and Pmod MIC3. The notable features include pong game (where audio signals are used to control the pedals), ability to select colour schemes for background, graph & font colour, interactive displays & graphs of voice signals and etc. The frequency detector algorithm implemented was able to achieve an accuracy of over 95%.

For more details, please refer to the `Final Report.pdf`.

## Feature List
| Features | Description |
| :---: | ---|
Menu Page | User will be be directed to a menu page displaying two options, ‘Graphs’ and ‘Pong’ respectively. User will have to press up or down button to toggle between the options and press the centre button to access the option that the user wants
Pong Game | Upon clicking the ‘Pong’ option in the menu display, user will be directed to the game. User needs to flip SW[2] to ‘on’ to start playing the pong game.To restart the game, player can flip SW[2] off then on. Player 1(P1) uses SW[15] while Player 2(P2) uses SW[3]. The game is a ordinary pong game with a twist: the ball size is tied to the mic input, therefore, to “kill” your opponent, you need to clap when the ball reaches the player paddle. The opponent can defend by clapping right before it reaches the paddle to deflect the ball. If one is unable to clap and defend, he/she can let the computer take over by flipping SW[4] and SW[14] for P1 and P2 respectively. However, note that the paddle moves faster when controlled by player.Game ends when one of the player’s score reaches 30. The user can flip SW[2] at this point to reset the game.
Side Menu | When BTNC is pressed, a side menu will pop up, allowing the user to exit whichever option they are currently in and directing them back to the menu display stated above in (1). This side menu is in both pong game and graph. For graph there is an additional option for color select and the current graph selected.
Basic Voice Visualizer | Upon clicking the ‘Graphs’ option in the menu display, user will be directed to the page displaying the real time voice waveform. When SW[0] = 1, the VGA displays the test wave. To display other visual representations of the input waveform(which will be discussed in greater details below, user will have to press either the BTNU or BTND button to toggle between the different visual representations of the input signal until he/she has reach the desired visual representation that he/she wants.
Volume Indicator | The LEDs from LD0 to LD11 light up with respect to the intensity of the input audio sample.
Seven Segment Display | The last two segments (AN1 & AN0) will display a numeric value between 0 and 12 with respect to the intensity of the input audio sample.
VGA | SW[7] hides axis <br /> SW[8] hides ticks <br /> SW[9] hides grid <br /> SW[10] hides waveform <br /> Pressing left and right on the main waveform would scroll through the 5 default color schemes.
Colour Select | In the unlikely event that the users do not like the color scheme, they are able to change it. SW[13:11] determines which part of the graph is changed. 0 - bg, 1 - grid, 2 - waveform, 3 - axis,4 - ticks.  <br /> <br /> To change the color, press the BTNC to open up the side menu and select color sel. Once inside, you can preview the selected color on the box next to the side menu, the user can then press the BTNC to confirm the change.
